### What is RFM Segmentation?

RFM segmentation allows marketers to target specific clusters of customers with communications that are much more relevant for their particular behavior – and thus generate much higher rates of response, plus increased loyalty and customer lifetime value. Like other segmentation methods, RFM segmentation is a powerful way to identify groups of customers for special treatment. RFM stands for recency, frequency and monetary.

### What are Recency, Frequency and Monetary?

**Recency:** How much time has elapsed since a customer’s last activity or transaction with the brand? Activity is usually a purchase, although variations are sometimes used, e.g., the last visit to a website or use of a mobile app. In most cases, the more recently a customer has interacted or transacted with a brand, the more likely that customer will be responsive to communications from the brand.

**Frequency:** How often has a customer transacted or interacted with the brand during a particular period of time? Clearly, customers with frequent activities are more engaged, and probably more loyal, than customers who rarely do so. And one-time-only customers are in a class of their own.

**Monetary:** Also referred to as “monetary value,” this factor reflects how much a customer has spent with the brand during a particular period of time. Big spenders should usually be treated differently than customers who spend little. Looking at monetary divided by frequency indicates the average purchase amount – an important secondary factor to consider when segmenting customers.

### Project Overview

I have used the Online Retail data set. Preprocess and clean the data and applied K Means Clustering algorithm for the segmentation.   

**Champions:** They are the champions

**Loyal customer:** Up-sell higher value products

**Promising Customer:** Customer with good monetary, frequency and less recency. Recommend other products. Engage in loyalty programs.

**Potential Loyalist:** Up-sell lower value products

**At Risk:** Have good frequency but awys from long days. Send personalised email or other messages to reconnect. Provide good offers and share valuable resources.

**Can't lose them:**  Seasonal Buyer with higher monetary. Win them back. Talk to them. Make them special offers. Make them feel valuable

**Needs Attention:** Away from long time. Help them to get back

**Needs Awareness:** Create brand awareness and help them to get back

**About to Sleep:** Reactivate them. Share valuable resources. Recommend popular products. Offer discounts.

**Hibernating:** they are losing, promote to get them back.
